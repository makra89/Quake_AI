# Generate Anchors

Taken and adapted from https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/scripts/gen_anchors.py.
Provide the path to the annotated aimbot images and specify how many anchors you want to have (choose 6 if you use a default model).
Afterwards replace the default anchors in yolov3_tf2/models.py
